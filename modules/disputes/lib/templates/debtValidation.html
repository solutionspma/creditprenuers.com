    RE: Validation of Debt – {{CREDITOR}}<br />
    Account Reference: {{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}}
  </div>

  <p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

  <div class="body">
    <p>
      I am writing to formally dispute the above-referenced account and request validation 
      of this alleged debt pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 
      15 U.S.C. § 1692g, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do not recognize this debt, and I am exercising my right to request the following 
      documentation:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Proof that you are licensed to collect in my state</li>
      <li>A copy of the original signed agreement between myself and the original creditor</li>
      <li>Complete payment history from the original creditor</li>
      <li>Proof that you have the authority to collect on this debt</li>
      <li>Verification that the statute of limitations has not expired</li>
      <li>Name and address of the original creditor</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Under the FDCPA, you are required to cease all collection activities until you have 
      provided adequate validation of this debt. Additionally, under the FCRA, you are 
      required to report this account as "disputed" to all credit bureaus.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you cannot provide the requested documentation within 30 days, I demand that you:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Remove this account from my credit reports immediately</li>
      <li>Cease all collection activities</li>
      <li>Provide written confirmation that this matter has been resolved</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Failure to comply with this request may result in a formal complaint to the Consumer 
      Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and my state's 
      Attorney General's office.
    </p>
