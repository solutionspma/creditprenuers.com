    RE: Method of Verification Request – {{CREDITOR}}<br />
    Account Reference: {{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}}
  </div>

  <p>Dear {{BUREAU}} Representative,</p>

  <div class="body">
    <p>
      I recently received your response to my dispute regarding the {{CREDITOR}} account. 
      Your response indicated that you "verified" the information as accurate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Pursuant to Section 611(a)(7) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. 
      § 1681i(a)(7), I am formally requesting that you provide me with a detailed 
      description of the <strong>method of verification</strong> used to determine 
      that the disputed information is accurate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Specifically, please provide:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The name, address, and telephone number of each person contacted in connection with such verification</li>
      <li>A summary of the response from the furnisher of information</li>
      <li>Documentation showing how the verification was conducted</li>
      <li>Copies of any documents you relied upon in making your determination</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The FCRA requires that you provide this information within 15 days of receiving 
      this request. Simply stating that the information was "verified" without 
      providing the actual method of verification does not satisfy your legal 
      obligations under the FCRA.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are unable to provide adequate documentation of your verification 
      procedures, I request that the disputed item be immediately deleted from 
      my credit file.
    </p>
