    RE: Goodwill Adjustment Request<br />
    Account Reference: {{ACCOUNT_NUMBER}}
  </div>

  <p>Dear Account Manager,</p>

  <div class="body">
    <p>
      I am writing to request a goodwill adjustment on my account. As a valued customer, 
      I am respectfully asking that you consider removing the negative mark(s) from my 
      credit report associated with this account.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want to acknowledge that I take full responsibility for the late payment(s) that 
      occurred. I understand that this was my obligation and that the negative reporting 
      is technically accurate.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, I would like to explain the circumstances that led to this situation:
    </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 20px; border-left: 3px solid #ddd; margin: 20px 0;">
      {{REASON}}
    </p>

    <p>
      Since that time, I have taken steps to ensure this does not happen again:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Set up automatic payments to prevent future late payments</li>
      <li>Created calendar reminders for payment due dates</li>
      <li>Improved my financial organization and budgeting</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I have been a loyal customer and value my relationship with {{CREDITOR}}. My account 
      is currently in good standing, and I am committed to maintaining a positive payment 
      history going forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      I respectfully request that, as a gesture of goodwill, you remove the late payment 
      notation(s) from my credit reports with all three major bureaus ({{BUREAU}}, Experian, 
      and TransUnion).
    </p>

    <p>
      This adjustment would greatly help my credit profile and would be deeply appreciated. 
      Thank you for considering my request.
    </p>
